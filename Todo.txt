Code is in working order, however event descriptions are not being added to drive - this needs fixed first


Once events are properly archiving into drive, outline and begin io testing
If any bugs are found, fix them, otherwise, proceed

Slow down bot loop
Produce a working module for each mimetype
Import modules to Samsara

\/

textfile generation:


Research text file creation
do it
put it in a module
add to samsara
upload to proper directory upon creation (during mime folder creation) and delete once finished
add location in drive to db


audio reading generation:
same as above


gif Generation: - must first create voice synthesis module as gif length is dictated by audio clip duration

Download images to a tmp directory
compile images into a gif
upload gif to source dir
store location of gif in db under the relevant event
clear tmp directory




Video Generation:

Take variate number of video clips and string them together, output the result and follow the same process as outlined above



Summary Document Generation: - this part is tricky

2 pages only
First page contains gif alongside standardized linking and the event's description
Second page is also standardized and also contains video and audio (embedded)
Due to need to embed media files, it is necessary to research the restrictions - I believe trawling through gdocs api will eventually work
Same as above


Once summary documents are generated, they must be linked into a table of contents system automatically


Begin work on discord querying and data presentation

Assess video generation







P.S. you have global imports as well as less-than-specific named parameters (pydrive) - fix this as a post-release patch, test github merging
