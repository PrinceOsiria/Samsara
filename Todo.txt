Produce a working compilation/generation module for each mimetype

Import modules to Samsara

Summary Document Generation: - this part is tricky

2 pages only
First page contains gif alongside standardized linking and the event's description
Second page is also standardized and also contains video and audio (embedded)
Due to need to embed media files, it is necessary to research the restrictions - I believe trawling through gdocs api will eventually work
Same as above


Once summary documents are generated, they must be linked into a table of contents system automatically


Begin work on discord querying and data presentation

Assess video generation







P.S. you have global imports as well as less-than-specific named parameters (pydrive) - fix this as a post-release patch, test github merging
