# Samsara
Samsara is a discord bot which assists in archival and information retrieval 

Archive contents include: Events - A combination of information and evidence to support an event occuring

Codename Samsara is a project which combines the successful attributes of many modules before it.
These modules are categorized into two sub-sections, which distinguish between the features of the application.

Firstly, Codename Samsara is a Discord Application. Within this application, there is a bot.
The bot is named DAE, or, Discord Archival Engine, and it's job it to scrape a remote shared sheet for data,
and use this data to populate a local filesystem. While this is being done, an internal SQL database is also constructed, mirroring the files passing through the bot.

Once the local database is up-to-date, the second half of DAE kicks into gear - namely, NITE.

NITE stands for Nameless Index Timeline Machine, and it's job is to take the local filesystem, and from it, generate an array of template files for each 
corresponding event.

From here, these templates are populated with whatever evidence and information was supplied to the relevant event.
These templates are then uploaded to drive, alongside the local archive. Also, the SQL database is updated, now linking to the location
that the document is hosted at


At the end of every month, at midnight, NITE begins a second wave of information abstraction. From the SQL database generated by DAE, NITE is able
to determine the events comprising a month, and furthermore, the location of the relevant documents.

It uses this information to construct a video, from a pre-determined template algorithm. The script is read as pictures fade by, followed by the
playing of any audio or video attached to the particular event

These videos are uploaded to drive, linked into the database, and uploaded to youtube. 
Once the upload finishes, a link appears in the server.

On top of this automation, exists the ability to query for specific information held within the archives.
This is done through "samsara commands", which is a fancy word for bot commands

The commands are listed in the documentation for DAE here:
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RAAEXNLteBPhPrgWLjrs1br4f069QtX4rH8KDy_ESiI/edit?usp=sharing

Roughly summarized, one can query any timeframe using one or more tags, which will return a JSON document with the relevant database contents.
If videos are desired, one need only query using the dedicated command for the desired year/month
Finally, Project 108 is bundled within Samsara, allowing encryption/decryption on mobile. 
All commands can be found at the link above
