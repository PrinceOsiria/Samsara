First, you'll need a discord bot. Then, use it's bot id in a file called 'run.py' and run the bot named 'dae' with it

Second, in the config file, change all directories and settings

Finally, on drive, ensure that you have the correct file tree (the drive scan will help you figure it out) and the correct permissions

Permissions are done via a service account, with local credentials. These are stored in dae/Archive as private_key.json

This should be all you need, if you're managing to read this (private repo?)
